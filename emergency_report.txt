[2] Summary Statistics:
  → Total Emergencies: 13
  → Emergencies by Type:
     - Crime: 5 (Resolved: 4, Avg. Severity: 6)
     - Fire: 4 (Resolved: 4, Avg. Severity: 7)
     - Medical: 4 (Resolved: 1, Avg. Severity: 4)
  → Zone-wise Emergency Distribution:
     - Zone 1: 5 cases
     - Zone 2: 4 cases
     - Zone 3: 4 cases

------------------------------------------------------------------
[3] Emergency Trend Prediction (using Dynamic Programming):
  Zone 1 Emergency History:
     - Fire: 1 cases
     - Medical: 1 cases
     - Crime: 3 cases
  Zone 2 Emergency History:
     - Fire: 2 cases
     - Medical: 1 cases
     - Crime: 1 cases
  Zone 3 Emergency History:
     - Fire: 1 cases
     - Medical: 2 cases
     - Crime: 1 cases

  → Prediction: Zone 1 is at highest risk.

------------------------------------------------------------------
[4] Dispatch Effectiveness (using Greedy Algorithm):
  → Total Dispatched Cases: 9
  → Pending / Unresolved Cases: 4
  → Dispatch Success Rate: 69%

------------------------------------------------------------------
[5] Zone-wise Emergency Load Analysis:
  - Zone 1: 5 emergencies → ✅ Normal Load
  - Zone 2: 4 emergencies → ✅ Normal Load
  - Zone 3: 4 emergencies → ✅ Normal Load

------------------------------------------------------------------
[6] Observations & Actionable Insights:
  • Some emergencies remain unresolved. Investigate reasons and increase response units.
  • High emergency volume in Zone 1. Recommend resource reinforcement.
  • Ensure continuous data collection to improve predictions.
  • Consider dynamic allocation of emergency vehicles based on recent trends.
